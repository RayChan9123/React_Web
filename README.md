# React + Vite
## This is a project created for practicing React and Tailwind by Ray Chan.The website is deployed at https://reactwithray.netlify.app/ 
#### The website is fully responsive! Meaning the element render to the end-user changes base on the screen size. Test it by dragging the window to simulate small, medium and large screen!
